## Overview
This repository contains a **comprehensive analysis** of the **L2 network**, a real-world social network extracted from Facebook. The study examines **structural properties, centrality measures, community detection**, and comparisons with theoretical models (**Erdős-Rényi & Barabási-Albert**).

## Features
- **General network metrics** (nodes, edges, clustering, path length, diameter)
- **Degree distribution** analysis with statistical fitting
- **Centrality measures** (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, Subgraph)
- **Community detection** (Louvain, Modularity Optimization, Girvan-Newman)
- **Comparison with random network models** (ER & BA)
- **Network visualization** (with highlighted influential nodes and diameter)
