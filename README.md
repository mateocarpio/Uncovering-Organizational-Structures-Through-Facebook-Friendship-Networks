## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the L2 network, a real-world social network extracted from Facebook. The study examines its structural properties, centrality measures, community detection, and comparisons with theoretical models (Erdős-Rényi and Barabási-Albert).

## 1) Networks
This folder contains the network data analyzed, stored in three CSV files:
-- edges.csv – Contains the network’s edge list.
-- nodes.csv – Stores node attributes.
-- gprops.csv – Includes general network properties.

## 2) Analyzer.ipynb          
This Jupyter notebook contains the complete analysis of the network, including all computations and visualizations.

## 3) Figures
This folder contains all figures generated during the analysis.

## 4) report.pdf
This file contains the full report summarizing the findings.



## Features Analized
- **General network metrics** (nodes, edges, clustering, path length, diameter)
- **Degree distribution** analysis with statistical fitting
- **Centrality measures** (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, Subgraph)
- **Community detection** (Louvain, Greedy)
- **Comparison with random network models** (ER & BA)
- **Network visualization** (with highlighted influential nodes and diameter)
